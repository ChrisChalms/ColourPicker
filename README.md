# Color Picker
I had to write a colour picker for a Unity project I was working on and thought it might be a useful bit of reusable functionality, so I've separated it out for aynone who might find it useful too. The only code that's really required for it to work is the ColourPicker.cs file, everything else just provides a little feedback.
